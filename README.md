# PostmanAPITesting
Project Overview
This project focuses on testing an API that manages student data using Postman. The API allows for the retrieval and management of student information, including details such as student IDs, names, locations, phone numbers, and courses enrolled. The JSON data provided serves as the test dataset for API requests and responses.

Objectives
Validate API Endpoints: Ensure that all API endpoints are functioning correctly and return the expected data.
CRUD Operations Testing: Test Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on the student data.
Data Integrity: Verify that the data returned by the API matches the expected data structure and values.
Error Handling: Check the APIâ€™s response to invalid requests and data.

Expected Outcomes
All API endpoints should function as expected and return the correct data.
CRUD operations should be thoroughly tested to ensure data integrity.
Error handling mechanisms should be validated to ensure robust API behavior in the face of invalid requests.
Conclusion
This project will provide a comprehensive testing framework for the student management API, ensuring its reliability and correctness. By using Postman, we will automate and validate the API functionality, making it easier to identify and fix issues promptly.
